# This module provides an abstraction for positioning a node in a binary tree,
# A `Position` uniquely identifies the location of a node

# In this implementation, `Position` is represented by the in-order-traversal sequence number
# of the node.  The process of locating a node and jumping between nodes is done through
# in-order position calculation, which can be done with bit manipulation.

# For example
# ```text
#      3
#     /  \
#    /    \
#   1      5 <-[Node index, a.k.a, Position]
#  / \    / \
# 0   2  4   6

# 0   1  2   3 <[Leaf index]
# ```
# Note1: The in-order-traversal counts from 0
# Note2: The level of tree counts from leaf level, start from 0
# Note3: The leaf index starting from left-most leaf, starts from 0
