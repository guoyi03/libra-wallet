# This module implements an in-memory Merkle Accumulator that is similar to what we use in
# storage. This accumulator will only store a small portion of the tree -- for any subtree that
# is full, we store only the root. Also we only store the frozen nodes, therefore this structure
# will always store up to `Log(n)` number of nodes, where `n` is the total number of leaves in
# the tree.
#
# This accumulator is immutable once constructed. If we append new leaves to the tree we will
# obtain a new accumulator instance and the old one remains unchanged.
